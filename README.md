<h1>Independent Project Proposal</h1>
<h2> Project Name: Portfolio, Reimagined</h2>
<h2> Overview</h2>
<p>Throughout my time in the School of Media Arts and Design program at James Madison, I have gotten the opportunity to learn new skills and software, curate designs, and work on long-term projects. While I have created a plethora of content that I am proud of, these constricting time schedules that accompany completing projects for a class does not always allow for me to perfect my work in a way that meets my personal standards. As I am a senior this year who plans on graduating in the Spring of 2022, I have been immersing myself into environments where I am able to get advice and have discussions with industry professionals. A skill that many people have told me is imperative to a modern-day career in this industry is a vast knowledge of Wordpress, which is a web design software that countless businesses, organizations, and even government sectors use. I have used Wordpress several times, but specifically in a previous SMAD class I have used Wordpress to create a portfolio. Due to the requirements of the project, I had to add certain elements that I otherwise would not have to my site, and overall could not include several of my accomplishments and projects that were not related to that specific course. I would like to revisit my Wordpress portfolio and cater the design and content toward something that I could realistically use as a portfolio in the future. I will add more recent content, reorganize the site to include a wider variety of content than was allotted for my previous project, and redesign the page to fit the aesthetic and brand that I would like to share with employers. </p>
<br>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>By the end of this project, I would like to be able to utilize this portfolio in a professional setting, be more familiar and comfortable with Wordpress, and have a formal portfolio that encapsulates all of the work I have done both in and outside of the JMU classrooms. </p>
